ðŸ“ˆ Business Strategy Agent Team
This example demonstrates a sophisticated team of AI agents designed to perform a comprehensive business strategy analysis for a given company.
The team consists of three specialized agents:
1.  **Market Research Agent**: Conducts web searches for market trends, news, and competitor analysis.
2.  **Financial Analyst Agent**: Fetches and analyzes financial data, such as stock performance and fundamentals.
3.  **Strategy Analyst Agent**: Synthesizes the gathered information into strategic frameworks like SWOT analysis and provides recommendations.
This multi-agent system showcases how to combine specialized tools and structured outputs to tackle complex, real-world tasks.
